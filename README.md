## Summary

As my final project for Web visualization course I decided to develop a simple website for an imaginary cat cafe. Since the course focused on visualization of websites (as the name suggests), the website does not have any "*real*" functionality. The forms can be sent, but the information in them doesn't go anywhere.

The site consists of 5 sections:

    - Home
        - Landing page, includes a little introduction of the cafe
    - Menu
        - Cafe's available menu
    - Cats
        - Images of cafe's cats
    - Contact us
        - Cafe's information and contact/feedback form
    - Reservations
        - Seat reservation form

I plan to develop this site further, and you can read about my development ideas from [Further development](#further-development).
